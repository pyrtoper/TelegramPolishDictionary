It is a dictionary Polish -> Russian and Russian -> Polish telegram bot. 
# **What he can do:**
1. In Polish -> Russian state:
   - Show to the user meanings of user's word, translated to Russian language;
   - If user's word is a noun, bot shows its forms according to Polish Declinations (Mianownik, DopeÅ‚niacz etc.);
   - Also shows probable transltations to the Russian language;
2. In Russian -> Polish state:
   - Shows probable translations of user's word to Polish language;
3. Additional functions:
   - Bot also supports "Did you mean..." function. If you misspelled the word, bot will suggest you similar to user's input words. So, you can type the word in different forms!
   - If user still could not find his word, user can warn bot that developer messed up by clicking special button (it is the last button among "Similar words" buttons);
